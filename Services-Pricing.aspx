    <h3>Services</h3>
    <p>Figuring out your website strategy can be a complicated process with a variety of avenues. At Boyga our goal is to make this process simple and effecient for you.</p>
    <p>We'll start things out with a basic questionnaire to gather information about your potential website project. This will help us figure out your project's requirements and scope.</p>
    <p>After we review your questionnaire we'll create a project blueprint with detailed information for you to review. You are NOT obligated to anything.</p>
    <p>We've worked on a number of different website solutions.</p>
